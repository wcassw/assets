# MariaDB Installation on Mac, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Linux


**Install MariaDB anywhere. Run it like you mean it.**

MariaDB is not just “the MySQL alternative.” It is one of the most practical open-source relational databases for teams that want speed, SQL familiarity, strong community roots, and deployment freedom.

But installing MariaDB today is not one-size-fits-all.

On a Mac, it is usually a fast Homebrew install. On Linux, it is a package-manager job with some security hardening. On AWS, you probably want Amazon RDS unless you need full OS-level control. On Azure, the story changed: Azure Database for MariaDB has been retired, so the right path is now a Linux VM, containers, Kubernetes, or migration to another managed database. On Google Cloud, Cloud SQL supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server, not native MariaDB, so you either self-manage MariaDB on Compute Engine or run it in containers.

That is the real lesson: **MariaDB is easy to install, but the right installation target depends on who will operate it at 2 a.m.**

This guide gives you practical installation examples across Mac, Linux, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, plus production notes that keep you out of the usual traps.

# 1. What MariaDB Is and When to Use It

MariaDB is an open-source relational database server created by the original developers of MySQL. It uses SQL, supports common MySQL-style tools and clients, and is widely used for web applications, internal platforms, reporting systems, and application backends.

MariaDB is a strong fit when you need:

- A proven relational database
- SQL compatibility with common MySQL workflows
- Open-source licensing
- Good Linux package support
- Easy local development setup
- Flexible cloud deployment options
- A database engine you can self-host when needed

MariaDB may not be the best first choice when you need:

- A fully managed cloud-native service on every provider
- Global serverless scaling without operational work
- Deep proprietary cloud database integrations
- Zero database administration responsibility

The important choice is not simply “MariaDB or not.” The real choice is:

**Do you want MariaDB managed for you, or do you want full control?**

That question drives almost every install path in this guide.

---

# 2. Before You Install: Pick the Right Deployment Model

Before running the first command, decide where MariaDB belongs in your stack.

## Local Development

Use this when you need MariaDB on your laptop for coding, testing, schema design, or local app development.

Best options:

- macOS with Homebrew
- Linux packages
- Docker Compose

## Self-Managed Server

Use this when you want OS-level control over configuration, storage, networking, plugins, logging, and tuning.

Best options:

- Linux VM on AWS EC2
- Linux VM on Azure
- Linux VM on Google Compute Engine
- Bare-metal Linux server

## Managed Cloud Database

Use this when you want the cloud provider to handle backups, patching, failover options, monitoring hooks, and routine database lifecycle tasks.

Best option:

- Amazon RDS for MariaDB on AWS

Important cloud reality:

- Azure Database for MariaDB has been retired.
- Google Cloud SQL does not provide native MariaDB as a managed engine.

## Containerized MariaDB

Use this when you need disposable local environments, CI databases, development stacks, or container-based deployments.

Best options:

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Kubernetes with persistent volumes

For production, containers can work well, but only if storage, backups, monitoring, upgrades, and failover are designed properly.

---

# 3. Install MariaDB on macOS

For most Mac users, the cleanest path is Homebrew.

## Prerequisites

You need:

- macOS
- Terminal access
- Homebrew installed

Check Homebrew:

```bash
brew --version
```

If Homebrew is missing, install it from the official Homebrew instructions, then return to this guide.

## Install MariaDB

```bash
brew update
brew install mariadb
```

## Start MariaDB

Start MariaDB as a background service:

```bash
brew services start mariadb
```

Or start it manually for the current terminal session:

```bash
mariadbd-safe --datadir="$(brew --prefix)/var/mysql"
```

Most developers should use `brew services start mariadb` because it behaves like a normal local service.

## Confirm MariaDB Is Running

```bash
brew services list
```

Then connect:

```bash
mariadb
```

You should land in the MariaDB shell.

## Secure the Installation

Run:

```bash
mariadb-secure-installation
```

Recommended choices for a local developer machine:

- Set or confirm root authentication
- Remove anonymous users
- Disable remote root login
- Remove the test database
- Reload privilege tables

## Create a Test Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE app_dev;
CREATE USER 'app_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'ChangeMe_Local_Only';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON app_dev.* TO 'app_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Connect as the app user:

```bash
mariadb -u app_user -p app_dev
```

## Stop MariaDB

```bash
brew services stop mariadb
```

## macOS Takeaway

MariaDB on macOS is best for development, not production. Use Homebrew, run the secure installation script, create a dedicated app user, and avoid using the root account from your application.

---

# 4. Install MariaDB on Linux

Linux is MariaDB’s natural home. The exact commands depend on your distribution.

This section covers Ubuntu/Debian and RHEL-family systems such as Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, Fedora, CentOS Stream, and RHEL.

---

## 4.1 Install MariaDB on Ubuntu or Debian

Update package metadata:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Install MariaDB:

```bash
sudo apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client -y
```

Start and enable the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now mariadb
```

Check status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mariadb
```

Run the secure installation helper:

```bash
sudo mariadb-secure-installation
```

Connect:

```bash
sudo mariadb
```

Create an application database and user:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE app_prod CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'app_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Use_A_Long_Random_Secret';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, INDEX ON app_prod.* TO 'app_user'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Exit:

```sql
EXIT;
```

### Bind Address for Remote Access

By default, many installs bind to localhost. To allow remote connections, edit the server config.

Common file paths include:

```bash
/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf
```

Find:

```ini
bind-address = 127.0.0.1
```

Change to:

```ini
bind-address = 0.0.0.0
```

Restart MariaDB:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mariadb
```

Open the firewall only from trusted sources. For example, with UFW:

```bash
sudo ufw allow from 203.0.113.10 to any port 3306 proto tcp
```

Do not expose port `3306` to the whole internet.

---

## 4.2 Install MariaDB on RHEL, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, Fedora, or CentOS Stream

Install MariaDB using DNF:

```bash
sudo dnf install mariadb-server mariadb -y
```

Start and enable the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now mariadb
```

Check status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mariadb
```

Secure the installation:

```bash
sudo mariadb-secure-installation
```

Connect:

```bash
sudo mariadb
```

Create a database and user:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE app_prod CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'app_user'@'10.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Use_A_Long_Random_Secret';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, INDEX ON app_prod.* TO 'app_user'@'10.%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Open the firewall for a private subnet only:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="10.0.0.0/8" port protocol="tcp" port="3306" accept'
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

## Linux Takeaway

Linux is the best self-managed MariaDB platform. Use your distribution packages for simple installs, use official MariaDB repositories when you need a specific version, and keep database access private by default.

---

# 5. Install MariaDB on AWS

On AWS, you have two main paths:

1. Use Amazon RDS for MariaDB.
2. Install MariaDB yourself on EC2.

For most production systems, RDS is the better default because AWS handles much of the operational load.

---

## 5.1 Option A: Amazon RDS for MariaDB

Amazon RDS for MariaDB is the managed route. You do not SSH into the database server. You create a database instance, configure networking, choose storage, set backups, and connect over the network.

### When to Use RDS

Use RDS when you want:

- Automated backups
- Easier patching
- Monitoring integration
- Optional high availability features
- Managed storage
- Simpler restore workflows
- Less OS administration

### Create an RDS MariaDB Instance with AWS CLI

Example:

```bash
aws rds create-db-instance \
  --db-instance-identifier app-mariadb-prod \
  --db-instance-class db.t4g.medium \
  --engine mariadb \
  --allocated-storage 50 \
  --master-username adminuser \
  --master-user-password 'Use-A-Long-Random-Password' \
  --backup-retention-period 7 \
  --storage-type gp3 \
  --no-publicly-accessible
```

For production, also specify the VPC, subnet group, security groups, encryption, backup window, maintenance window, and deletion protection.

Example with stronger production posture:

```bash
aws rds create-db-instance \
  --db-instance-identifier app-mariadb-prod \
  --db-instance-class db.m7g.large \
  --engine mariadb \
  --allocated-storage 100 \
  --storage-type gp3 \
  --master-username adminuser \
  --master-user-password 'Use-A-Long-Random-Password' \
  --backup-retention-period 14 \
  --preferred-backup-window '02:00-03:00' \
  --preferred-maintenance-window 'sun:03:00-sun:04:00' \
  --db-subnet-group-name app-db-subnet-group \
  --vpc-security-group-ids sg-0123456789abcdef0 \
  --storage-encrypted \
  --deletion-protection \
  --no-publicly-accessible
```

### Connect to RDS MariaDB

After the instance is available, get the endpoint:

```bash
aws rds describe-db-instances \
  --db-instance-identifier app-mariadb-prod \
  --query 'DBInstances[0].Endpoint.Address' \
  --output text
```

Connect:

```bash
mariadb \
  -h app-mariadb-prod.abc123.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com \
  -u adminuser \
  -p
```

Create an application database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE app_prod CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'app_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Use_A_Long_Random_Secret';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, INDEX ON app_prod.* TO 'app_user'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### AWS Security Group Rule

Allow inbound TCP 3306 only from your application security group or trusted private CIDR.

Bad idea:

```text
0.0.0.0/0 -> 3306
```

Better idea:

```text
App security group -> DB security group -> TCP 3306
```

## 5.2 Option B: Install MariaDB on EC2

Use EC2 when you need:

- Full server control
- Custom MariaDB plugins
- Filesystem-level tuning
- Special backup agents
- Custom replication topology
- Lower-level OS access

Example on Ubuntu EC2:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client -y
sudo systemctl enable --now mariadb
sudo mariadb-secure-installation
```

Example on Amazon Linux / RHEL-style systems:

```bash
sudo dnf install mariadb-server mariadb -y
sudo systemctl enable --now mariadb
sudo mariadb-secure-installation
```

Then restrict access with security groups. Do not rely only on the Linux firewall.

### EC2 Storage Notes

For serious workloads:

- Use EBS gp3 or io2 depending on latency and IOPS needs.
- Put data on a dedicated volume.
- Enable EBS encryption.
- Snapshot before major upgrades.
- Monitor disk queue, free space, IOPS, and latency.

## AWS Takeaway

On AWS, use RDS for MariaDB unless you have a clear reason to self-manage. If you install on EC2, treat the VM like a production database host: private subnet, encrypted storage, locked-down security groups, backups, monitoring, and tested restores.

---

# 6. Install MariaDB on Azure

Azure needs a clear warning up front:

**Azure Database for MariaDB has been retired.**

That means a new production MariaDB plan on Azure usually means one of these:

1. Install MariaDB on an Azure Linux VM.
2. Run MariaDB in containers on Azure Kubernetes Service.
3. Use a marketplace or partner solution if your organization approves it.
4. Migrate the workload to Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server if compatibility allows.

This section focuses on the practical VM route.

---

## 6.1 Create an Azure Linux VM for MariaDB

Example using Azure CLI:

```bash
az group create \
  --name rg-mariadb-prod \
  --location eastus
```

Create a VM:

```bash
az vm create \
  --resource-group rg-mariadb-prod \
  --name vm-mariadb-prod-01 \
  --image Ubuntu2204 \
  --size Standard_D2s_v5 \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --generate-ssh-keys \
  --public-ip-sku Standard
```

For production, place the VM in a private subnet and avoid direct public database access.

SSH into the VM:

```bash
ssh azureuser@<public-ip-or-private-ip>
```

Install MariaDB:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client -y
sudo systemctl enable --now mariadb
sudo mariadb-secure-installation
```

Create database and user:

```bash
sudo mariadb
```

```sql
CREATE DATABASE app_prod CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'app_user'@'10.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Use_A_Long_Random_Secret';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, INDEX ON app_prod.* TO 'app_user'@'10.%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

## 6.2 Azure Network Security Group Rule

Open MariaDB only to trusted private sources.

Example:

```bash
az network nsg rule create \
  --resource-group rg-mariadb-prod \
  --nsg-name vm-mariadb-prod-01NSG \
  --name AllowMariaDBFromAppSubnet \
  --priority 200 \
  --direction Inbound \
  --access Allow \
  --protocol Tcp \
  --source-address-prefixes 10.10.0.0/24 \
  --destination-port-ranges 3306
```

Avoid:

```text
Internet -> 3306
```

## 6.3 Azure Disk Notes

For production:

- Use Premium SSD or Ultra Disk based on workload needs.
- Put MariaDB data on a dedicated managed disk.
- Use Azure Backup or snapshot workflows.
- Monitor disk latency, throughput, and free space.
- Test restore procedures before you need them.

## 6.4 Azure Managed Alternative

If your application can run on MySQL instead of MariaDB, evaluate Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server. Do not assume full compatibility. Test schema, routines, SQL modes, functions, collations, authentication, replication assumptions, and application queries.

## Azure Takeaway

Azure is no longer a native managed MariaDB destination. Use a Linux VM or containers if you require MariaDB specifically. If you want a managed Azure database, test migration to MySQL Flexible Server carefully before committing.

---

# 7. Install MariaDB on Google Cloud

Google Cloud has a similar deployment decision:

**Cloud SQL does not provide native managed MariaDB.**

Cloud SQL supports managed relational engines such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. If you need MariaDB specifically, the usual path is a self-managed VM on Compute Engine or a containerized deployment.

---

## 7.1 Install MariaDB on Google Compute Engine

Create a VM:

```bash
gcloud compute instances create vm-mariadb-prod-01 \
  --zone=us-central1-a \
  --machine-type=e2-standard-2 \
  --image-family=ubuntu-2204-lts \
  --image-project=ubuntu-os-cloud \
  --boot-disk-size=50GB \
  --boot-disk-type=pd-balanced
```

SSH into the VM:

```bash
gcloud compute ssh vm-mariadb-prod-01 --zone=us-central1-a
```

Install MariaDB:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client -y
sudo systemctl enable --now mariadb
sudo mariadb-secure-installation
```

Create database and user:

```bash
sudo mariadb
```

```sql
CREATE DATABASE app_prod CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'app_user'@'10.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Use_A_Long_Random_Secret';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, INDEX ON app_prod.* TO 'app_user'@'10.%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

## 7.2 Google Cloud Firewall Rule

Allow MariaDB only from a trusted private range:

```bash
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-mariadb-from-app \
  --allow=tcp:3306 \
  --source-ranges=10.20.0.0/24 \
  --target-tags=mariadb-server \
  --description="Allow MariaDB from application subnet only"
```

Apply the network tag:

```bash
gcloud compute instances add-tags vm-mariadb-prod-01 \
  --zone=us-central1-a \
  --tags=mariadb-server
```

## 7.3 Google Cloud Disk Notes

For production:

- Use a dedicated persistent disk for MariaDB data.
- Pick disk type based on workload: balanced persistent disk, SSD persistent disk, or Hyperdisk where appropriate.
- Snapshot before upgrades.
- Monitor disk latency and free space.
- Avoid running production data only on a boot disk.

## 7.4 Google Cloud Managed Alternative

If managed database operations are more important than exact MariaDB compatibility, evaluate Cloud SQL for MySQL. But test carefully. MariaDB and MySQL are related, not identical. Compatibility gaps can appear in SQL syntax, storage engines, functions, replication behavior, authentication, and optimizer behavior.

## Google Cloud Takeaway

Google Cloud is a good place to run MariaDB, but usually as self-managed MariaDB on Compute Engine or containers. If you need a fully managed service, Cloud SQL for MySQL may be an alternative, but it is not the same thing as MariaDB.

---

# 8. Install MariaDB with Docker

Docker is the fastest way to run MariaDB for local development, test environments, and CI jobs.

## Run MariaDB with Docker

```bash
docker volume create mariadb_data
```

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name mariadb-dev \
  -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD='RootPassword_ChangeMe' \
  -e MARIADB_DATABASE='app_dev' \
  -e MARIADB_USER='app_user' \
  -e MARIADB_PASSWORD='AppPassword_ChangeMe' \
  -p 3306:3306 \
  -v mariadb_data:/var/lib/mysql \
  mariadb:11
```

Connect from the host:

```bash
mariadb -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u app_user -p app_dev
```

Stop the container:

```bash
docker stop mariadb-dev
```

Start it again:

```bash
docker start mariadb-dev
```

## Docker Compose Example

Create `compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: mariadb:11
    container_name: app-mariadb
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD: RootPassword_ChangeMe
      MARIADB_DATABASE: app_dev
      MARIADB_USER: app_user
      MARIADB_PASSWORD: AppPassword_ChangeMe
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    volumes:
      - mariadb_data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  mariadb_data:
```

Start it:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

View logs:

```bash
docker logs app-mariadb
```

Connect:

```bash
mariadb -h 127.0.0.1 -u app_user -p app_dev
```

## Docker Takeaway

Docker is excellent for repeatable development environments. For production, do not treat a container as the whole database architecture. You still need persistent storage, backups, monitoring, controlled upgrades, secrets management, and recovery testing.

---

# 9. First-Day Security Checklist

A fresh MariaDB install is only the beginning. Before you let an application depend on it, run through this checklist.

## 1. Run the Secure Installation Helper

```bash
sudo mariadb-secure-installation
```

This helps remove risky defaults.

## 2. Do Not Use Root from the Application

Create a dedicated application user:

```sql
CREATE USER 'app_user'@'10.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Use_A_Long_Random_Secret';
```

Grant only what the app needs:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON app_prod.* TO 'app_user'@'10.%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

## 3. Restrict Network Access

Good:

```text
Application subnet -> MariaDB port 3306
```

Bad:

```text
Internet -> MariaDB port 3306
```

## 4. Turn on Backups

A database without tested backups is a temporary cache with better branding.

Use one or more of:

- Managed backups on RDS
- VM snapshots
- `mariadb-dump`
- Physical backup tools
- Replication-based backup host

## 5. Monitor the Basics

Track:

- CPU
- Memory
- Disk free space
- Disk latency
- Connections
- Slow queries
- Replication lag, if any
- Backup success
- Error logs

## 6. Patch Deliberately

Do not blindly auto-upgrade production databases. Patch with a plan:

1. Snapshot or backup.
2. Test in staging.
3. Check release notes.
4. Schedule a maintenance window.
5. Confirm rollback options.
6. Verify the application after upgrade.

---

# 10. Basic Database and User Examples

## Create a Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE app_prod CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

## Create a Local User

```sql
CREATE USER 'app_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'StrongPasswordHere';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON app_prod.* TO 'app_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

## Create a Private-Network User

```sql
CREATE USER 'app_user'@'10.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'StrongPasswordHere';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON app_prod.* TO 'app_user'@'10.%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

## Show Databases

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

## Show Users

```sql
SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;
```

## Check Version

```sql
SELECT VERSION();
```

## Create a Sample Table

```sql
USE app_prod;

CREATE TABLE customers (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Insert a Row

```sql
INSERT INTO customers (email, name)
VALUES ('jane@example.com', 'Jane Example');
```

## Query It

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers;
```

---

# 11. Backup and Restore Examples

Backups are not real until you restore them successfully.

## Logical Backup with mariadb-dump

```bash
mariadb-dump -u root -p \
  --single-transaction \
  --routines \
  --triggers \
  --events \
  app_prod > app_prod.sql
```

## Restore a Logical Backup

```bash
mariadb -u root -p app_prod < app_prod.sql
```

## Backup All Databases

```bash
mariadb-dump -u root -p \
  --all-databases \
  --single-transaction \
  --routines \
  --triggers \
  --events > all_databases.sql
```

## Compress Backup

```bash
mariadb-dump -u root -p --single-transaction app_prod | gzip > app_prod.sql.gz
```

## Restore Compressed Backup

```bash
gunzip < app_prod.sql.gz | mariadb -u root -p app_prod
```

## Production Backup Notes

For production, consider:

- Backup encryption
- Offsite copy
- Retention policy
- Restore testing
- Point-in-time recovery where available
- Backup monitoring
- Recovery time objective
- Recovery point objective

The backup question is not “Do we have a file?”

The real question is:

**Can we restore the business before the business notices?**

---

# 12. Troubleshooting Common Installation Problems

## Problem: Cannot Connect Locally

Check service status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mariadb
```

Check listening ports:

```bash
sudo ss -lntp | grep 3306
```

Check logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u mariadb --no-pager -n 100
```

## Problem: Access Denied

Confirm username and host:

```sql
SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;
```

Remember: in MariaDB, this is not just the username:

```text
app_user
```

It is the username plus host:

```text
'app_user'@'localhost'
'app_user'@'10.%'
'app_user'@'%'
```

Those are different accounts.

## Problem: Remote Connections Fail

Check four things:

1. MariaDB bind address
2. Linux firewall
3. Cloud firewall or security group
4. User host permissions

Check bind address:

```bash
sudo grep -R "bind-address" /etc/mysql /etc/my.cnf* 2>/dev/null
```

Check port:

```bash
sudo ss -lntp | grep 3306
```

## Problem: Port 3306 Is Open to the Internet

Close it immediately at the cloud firewall or security group layer.

Then allow only trusted sources.

## Problem: Docker Container Loses Data

You probably started MariaDB without a persistent volume.

Use a named volume:

```bash
docker volume create mariadb_data
```

Run with:

```bash
-v mariadb_data:/var/lib/mysql
```

## Problem: Application Cannot Authenticate

Check:

- Password value
- User host value
- Authentication plugin expectations
- TLS requirements
- Special characters in connection strings
- Whether the app is connecting from localhost, container network, private subnet, or public IP

---

# 13. Production Takeaways

## MariaDB Is Easy to Install. Operations Are the Hard Part.

The install command is rarely the risky part. The real work is backups, restore testing, monitoring, patching, access control, storage planning, and incident response.

## Use Managed MariaDB Where It Exists and Fits.

On AWS, Amazon RDS for MariaDB is often the best production default.

## Do Not Assume Every Cloud Has Managed MariaDB.

Azure retired its managed MariaDB service. Google Cloud SQL does not offer native MariaDB. On those platforms, plan for self-managed MariaDB or carefully test a MySQL-compatible managed alternative.

## Keep the Database Private.

A public MariaDB port is an invitation to pain. Use private networking, security groups, firewall rules, VPNs, bastions, or private connectivity.

## Test Restores, Not Just Backups.

A backup that has never been restored is a theory.

## Pin Versions for Predictability.

For servers and containers, avoid surprise upgrades. Pick versions deliberately, read release notes, and test upgrades before production.

## Give Applications Least Privilege.

Your app probably does not need global privileges. Grant only the database-level permissions it needs.

---

# Finally

MariaDB gives you freedom. That freedom is the selling point — and the responsibility.

On your Mac, MariaDB can be running in minutes. On Linux, it is a reliable self-managed workhorse. On AWS, RDS gives you a managed path that removes much of the operational burden. On Azure and Google Cloud, you need to be more intentional because native managed MariaDB is not the default path.

The punchline is simple:

**Install MariaDB where it makes sense. Secure it before you trust it. Back it up before you need it. Restore it before you brag about it.**
